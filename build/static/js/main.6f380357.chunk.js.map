This relates to Kirby’s history in that the first Kirby game was available on the original Game Boy, which has graphics that are more pixelated than what we see in video games today. In our implementation, we decided to maintain the 2D pixel-art style with no graphics upgrade.\"\n    },\n    {\n        image: c4,\n        title: \"Concept Sketch 4\",\n        description: \"This idea involves the trend of ASMR.

For example, spamming the button leads to Kirby playing the Game Boy- and the sounds associated with that. In our implementation, doing a long hold of the button will cause Kirby to eat and then say ‘Poyo!’- this ASMR sketch definitely inspired the many sound effects in our project. Other sounds that can be heard in our project include: Kirby inhaling, an item coming out of the pot, an item landing on the grass, a meme displaying on the mirror, and the background music.\"\n    },\n    {\n        image: c5,\n        title: \"Concept Sketch 5\",\n        description: \"This sketch depicts Kirby as the button.

We took this idea further by having the memes displayed on a mirror each time Kirby inhales a tomato- which can be attained with a double click on our button.

In this sketch, Kirby is the button and each press leads to different versions of Kirby- versions of him in his copy ability forms- being displayed. In our project, Kirby must inhale a ‘copy ability’ item in order to transform.

After a certain number of regular enemies, a boss enemy will appear. The boss would take 5-10 pills to defeat. This idea is like a mini game.

The user should press the button to feed Kirby the item that is in the middle slot of the column. If Kirby eats a non-food item, the user is met with a ‘Game Over’ screen. The final variation is like the second idea but it incorporates lives. Every time Kirby eats a non-food item, his life supply depletes.
